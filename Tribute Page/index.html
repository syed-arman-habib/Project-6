      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas al Zahrawi, better known as Al-Zahrawi, was an illustrious medieval Arab Muslim physician and surgeon who lived and practiced during the golden era of Islamic Civilization. His best claim to fame is the ‘Kitab-al-Tasrif’—a compilation of 30 tomes dedicated to medical practices. Together with Ibn Sina and Al-Razi, Zahrawi is regarded as one of the most accomplished Arab Muslim medical practitioners of the ‘Middle Ages’ and is also looked upon as the ‘Father of Modern Surgery’. Al-Zahrawi was the Archiater (the chief physician) in the court of the Spanish Caliph ‘Abd Ar-Rahman III an-Nasir. His magnum-opus on medicine and surgery, ‘Kitab al-Tasrif’, despite heavily borrowing from ‘Epitomae’ by ‘Paul of Aegina’—a 7th century Byzantine general practitioner—and incorporating Greco-Roman traditional as well as Middle Eastern wisdom, also detailed personal observations. For instance, Al-Zahrawi’s detailed description of hemophilia was the earliest known account on the medical condition. The medical compendium runs to more than 1500 pages with distinct sections dedicated to ‘surgery’, medicine, ‘ophthalmology’, and ‘orthopedics. The encyclopedia contains illustrative descriptions of about 200 surgical instruments, and taxonomy of 325 diseases complete with symptomatology and healing procedures. ‘Kitab al-Tasrif’ was the first medical tome to devote 300 pages exclusively to surgery, including surgical dentistry and dermatology. So, it is hardly surprising that Zahrawi’s groundbreaking encyclopedia highly stimulated contemporary Oriental and Occidental scholars to delve into Islamic medical literature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zahrawi" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

      <h5>Al-Tasrif</h5>
      <p>Al-Zahrawi's work Kitab al-Tasrif liman ajiza al al-talif is universally acknowledged as the first systematic, comprehensive and illustrated textbook of surgery. The book, which runs into 30 volumes, is a veritable encyclopaedia of medicine and surgery. <a href="http://www.iosminaret.org/vol-5/issue3/Al-Zahrawi.php" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

      <br/><br/>
      <h5>Cauterization</h5>
      <p>Book I of Al-Tasrif is entirely devoted to cauterization, a surgical procedure that has nearly disappeared in modern surgery. As a matter of fact, most people today doubt its efficacy. Cauterization can be done by heat (where the tissue trauma is localised), or by chemicals such as caustics. Al-Zahrawi generally preferred the former. <a href="http://www.iosminaret.org/vol-5/issue3/Al-Zahrawi.php" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

      <h5>Original Operations and Instruments</h5>
      <p>Spink and Lewis and other historians of medicine have ascribed the invention of a large number of surgical instruments and their original operation to Al-Zahrawi. <a href="http://www.iosminaret.org/vol-5/issue3/Al-Zahrawi.php" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

        <p>"The chief influence of Albucasis on the medical system of Europe was that his lucidity and method of presentation awakened a prepossession in favour of Arabic literature among the scholars of the West: the methods of Albucasis eclipsed those of Galen and maintained a dominant position in medical Europe for five hundred years, i.e long after it had passed its usefulness. He, however, helped to raise the status of surgery in Christian Europe; in his book on fractures and luxations, he states that ‘this part of surgery has passed into the hands of vulgar and uncultivated minds, for which reason it has fallen into contempt.’ The surgery of Albucasis became firmly grafted on Europe after the time of Guy de Chauliac."</p>
